Hello? Hi, is this Amy? Yes, it is. Hey, this is Elizabeth. I'm calling from Postcardmania. I got your application for our customer support position. How are you doing? I'm great. How are you doing? I'm good, too. Thank you. I was wondering if now might be a good time for a brief phone interview. Are you available? Yeah, of course. Okay, awesome. Great. So did you actually get a chance to research us here at Postcard mania? Like, do you know what we do as a company a little bit, just from the. What you have on? Indeed there. But mostly what I got from it is that you work with a bunch of different types of businesses potentially. Is that correct? Yeah, yeah, exactly. We do their marketing, so specifically for small business owners, we can do direct mail marketing or anything online. Makes sense. Okay. Yeah. Okay, good. Now, the other thing about us that's pretty cool that I like to tell people is that we are actually one of Tampa Bay's top places to work for, which is something that I'm super proud of. I do like to be upfront that the hiring process includes keeping this place clean and wholesome. So we will run a background check as well as a fully negative drug test, regardless of medical cards or prescriptions of any kind. So would there be anything that would come up on that for you? No, not at all. Okay, cool. Okay, great. And so are you currently employed? I am with Uber technologies. I'm currently a driver right now. Oh, nice. Okay. And how long have you been with Uber? I've been with Uber since July 2020. And the reason that I ended up going to Uber technologies is because at the time, I was working at Spectrum as a social media representative and technical support. But I had decided to go to college to get my associate's degree. And so Uber allowed me to have a way more flexible schedule so that I could do that. But now that I've gotten my associate's degree, I'm in the process of getting my bachelor's now. But I'm going part time, and so I have, you know, way more availability and time to give to a job again. Great. Okay, so you are looking for, like, full time work? Oh, yes, 100%. Okay. Okay, cool. Makes sense. What are you getting your degree in? Science. Biology in particular. Okay. What do you want to do with that degree? I would like to possibly work in a lab one day. That would be the end goal. An environmental lab in particular. Okay, cool. Nice. All right. So before Uber, I see that you worked at Spectrum chartered communications. I would love to hear a little bit more about your time there, sure. Yeah. So I originally got hired with Spectrum, which was formerly known as Bright House, and I was first hired there as a customer care professional. So basically my main duties were to assist with any customer related issues on the account, help start up new accounts. I was doing upselling techniques as well, and just overall assisting customers with any issues they may have. And then I had eventually transferred to a new department and a new office as a social media representative, and that was when they did actually change over to spectrum. And there I did essentially the same duties as I did as a customer care professional, but a lot more tech support was involved as well, and that was done over Facebook and Twitter. Gotcha. So I would basically, like, speak to customers through, like, a chat based type of system. Cool. Okay. Okay, good. And did you say you were on the phone with customers as well? Yes, yes. When I was a customer care professional, that was all over the phone. Cool. When I went to social media representatives, did it switch over to chat? I did also speak with customers on the phone, but not as much. Okay. Okay, fine. Makes sense. Are you comfortable being on the phone? Oh, yeah, of course. Okay. Yeah, 100%. Okay, good. Yeah, this phone is, or this position is pretty heavy on the phone. Yeah, yeah. Mostly because we have clients all over the country. So because of that reason. Yeah, we just basically never stops ringing you. Your only options are phone and email at that point because we don't really have too many people come to the office. Yeah. So it sounds like you. Of course, there's no in person dynamic there. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Well, I have no issues with being on the phone at all. I'm extremely comfortable with that. I know some people may struggle with that a little bit, but that's something I'm completely comfortable with. Okay, good. Perfect. Okay, good. So basically, this position is full time Monday through Friday from 09:00 a.m. to 06:00 p.m. and then we start the pay at dollar 18 an hour. Do both of those things work for you? Yes. Okay, awesome. Okay, good. Well, do you have any questions for me? No, not at all. Oh, actually, I do have one. I'm sorry. What would you say would be the most challenging aspect of this position? Probably just the amount of communication involved. Because we have over 150,000 clients, each customer service rep ends up working with roughly three to 400 customers on a weekly basis. So it's a lot of inflow and a lot of outflow. They're already clients, so it's not outflow in terms of trying to sell them or sign them up. That's not part of this job. But you are calling them or emailing them for follow up. They're calling you with questions, you're coordinating with the staff. So just really being able to keep up with the amount of communication needed. Okay, that's great. I'm definitely comfortable with, like, building a rapport with clients and customers and very comfortable with speaking with them. And my communication skills are very high, so I think I definitely would be a good fit. For sure. Yay. Okay, good. Well, I would love to have you come in for an in person interview. Are you available tomorrow? I am. Okay, awesome. So I am just looking here at our calendar to see what time it looks like tomorrow. We could do 1130. Would that work for you? Yeah, that would be great, actually. Okay, fantastic. And then let me just make sure. Do I have a good email address for you? Why don't you just give me your email address? Is it amysirklebot@gmail.com? yeah, it's just my first and last name at Gmail. If you need me to spell it, I will. I think I have it, but thank you. Okay, good. Yeah. So I will send you a confirmation email. That way you know our directions on where to park. There will also be a link to a postcard mania application. If you can just fill that out before tomorrow, it'll speed everything up when you get here. Okay, awesome. That sounds great. Thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely. I look forward to meeting with you and I hope you have a great rest of your day. Yes, me too. Take care, Elizabeth. Thank you. Bye.
